Algorithm idea:

for episode in episodes:
    WareHouse.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        for agent in WareHouse:
            state = agent.get_state()
            action = agent.get_action(state)
            reward, next_state, done = WareHouse.step(next_action, agent)
            agent.store(state, reward, next_state)

            if agent.memory is full:
                agent.train()

            if done:
                break

        if episode % C == 0:
            update all agent networks
